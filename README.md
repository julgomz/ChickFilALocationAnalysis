# ChickFilALocationAnalysis

## Overview

The ChickFilALocationAnalysis project aims to scrape all Chick-fil-A locations from the official website and analyze the distribution of these locations across different ZIP codes. By converting this data into a Tableau map, we can visually represent the spread of Chick-fil-A outlets and explore potential correlations between the presence of these locations in certain ZIP codes and various demographic or geographic factors.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to uncover any significant correlations between Chick-fil-A locations and specific occurrences or characteristics within those ZIP codes. This could include demographic trends, economic factors, or geographic features. By identifying these patterns, we can gain insights into Chick-fil-A's location strategy and the factors that might influence the success or presence of their outlets.

## Methodology

1. **Data Scraping**: Python code is used to scrape the official Chick-fil-A website for information on all its locations. This includes addresses, ZIP codes, and any other available details about each outlet.

2. **Data Transformation**: The scraped data, particularly ZIP codes, are processed and prepared for visualization.

3. **Visualization**: Using Tableau, we create a comprehensive map that plots all Chick-fil-A locations based on the processed data. This map serves as a visual tool to identify patterns and correlations.

4. **Analysis**: We conduct a thorough analysis to explore any correlations between Chick-fil-A locations and specific factors within their ZIP codes. The aim is to identify any significant patterns that could inform about Chick-fil-A's location selection criteria or about the ZIP codes themselves.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: For web scraping and data manipulation.
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and mapping.
